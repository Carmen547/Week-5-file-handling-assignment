Python File Handling Assignment
Overview
This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python, including creating, writing, reading, appending, and error handling. The script file_handling_assignment.py performs the following tasks:
1.	Creates a text file named my_file.txt and writes some content.
2.	Reads the file content and displays it on the console.
3.	Appends additional content to the file.
4.	Implements error handling to gracefully handle potential file-related exceptions.
